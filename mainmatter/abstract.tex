This document describes the work done on behalf of \company{ioTech}, \company{Slightly Mad Studios}, and the \company{University of Trento} on the integration of a third-party vehicle traffic software in a proprietary game engine. This is part of an industry-wide effort to leverage computer simulations to advance research on ground-based transportation, both in an academic and enterprise setting. The ultimate goal is having the game engine acting as the on-screen visualization for the traffic software's underlying traffic simulation: to achieve this, data must be exchanged through a typical network stack (either via \FONTsmallcaps{udp} or \FONTsmallcaps{tcp}), thus requiring a middleware agnostic to both any traffic software, and any game engine. The network layer of this middleware was implemented in two ways, one based on low-level operating system libraries, the other on an higher level framework; the performance of the resulting implementations were first measured, and then compared. The results show that, albeit with limited performance tradeoffs, pre-existing network frameworks like \software{\FONTsmallcaps{0mq}} have inherent development process advantages over home-grown solutions.
