This document describes the work done on behalf of \company{ioTech}, \company{Slightly Mad Studios}, and the \company{University of Trento} on the development of a middleware for the integration of a third-party vehicle traffic software in a proprietary game engine. This is a modest contribution to an industry-wide effort to leverage computer simulations for research on ground-based transportation, both in academic and enterprise settings. The project's ultimate goal is having a game engine visually render a traffic software's underlying traffic simulation: to achieve this, data must be exchanged through a typical network stack (\FONTsmallcaps{udp} or \FONTsmallcaps{tcp} based), thus requiring a middleware agnostic to both any traffic software, and any game engine. This middleware's network layer was implemented in two ways, one based on low-level operating system libraries, the other on an higher level framework. The performance of the resulting implementations was first measured, and then compared: the results show that, albeit with limited tradeoffs, pre-existing network frameworks like \software{\FONTsmallcaps{0mq}} have inherent development process advantages over home-grown solutions.
