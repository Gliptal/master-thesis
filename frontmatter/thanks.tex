I would like to thank my parents and my family, for their love and constant support they gave me all my life.

Giulia, for this new great chapter of my life we started together.

My flatmates Edoardo, Federico, and Elisa, some of whom I have known for more than 10 years.

My master's course companions, Alessandro Pezz√®, Federico Baldessari, and Marco Michelotti, without whom I would have passed half the exams with half the grades.

Luca Gasbarro for truly believing in my work; Nima Azarmgin and the ioTech team for their welcoming and support; Ged Keaveney and the SMS team for the patience and willingness to help me out.

My friends everywhere, that all helped me shape as the person I am now; the 476th vFG, for making me feel like part of an elite.

Anyone else that I may have missed in my forgetfulness.
